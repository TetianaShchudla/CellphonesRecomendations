# Welcome to the SQL project of the phones recommendation!

I want to present you the project in SQL Server according to this [Dataset in Kaffle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirnizri/cellphones-recommendations?resource=download).

You can find the results of __Data Exploration__ as well as __Data Cleaning__ for answering on multiple questions regarding price, brand, quantity of users of the highlighted phones etc.

I hope it will be useful.
